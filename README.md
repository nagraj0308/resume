# Résumé 

### About
It is my simple resume made with HTML, CSS, JS using JSON data.   
Initially the project was written with NodeJS architecture. [View Old Project](https://github.com/methusael13/resume-builder)

HTML is used for making initial block structure of the page with some simple data, CSS is used for giving some style to the page and JS is used to create small UI components dynamically and fill the data into page. All the data about details related to user is stored as a JSON object in a JS file.

### Getting Started

#### Using GitHub Pages
_( Make sure you have a GitHub account )_
1. Fork this repo by clicking the **Fork** button on top-right corner.
2. Go to the forked repo on your profile (It opens by default).    
3. Edit `data/profile.js` file using GitHub online editor and fill your own data.  
4. Open the settings of repo and enable [github pages](https://pages.github.com/) choosing source to `master` branch.  
5. Visit `https://<your GitHub username>.github.io/resume` in your browser.  
6. Additionaly you can print/save the page as PDF.  

#### Using local development
If you are a web-developer like me and want to run this on your local system then follow the instructions mentioned below.  
The project need to be hosted using any Web-Server like `apache`, `tomcat`, `http-server` or `SimpleHTTPServer` etc. I use `http-server` as it is very simple to use. Install `http-server` from [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/http-server) (NodeJS and npm need to installed first to run it).

1. Clone the repo using git or download zip of project on your local system.
To clone
```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/imvpn22/resume.git
```

2. Go into the `resume` directory and run
```bash
$ http-server
```
which will show something like

```bash
Starting up http-server, serving ./
Available on:
  http://127.0.0.1:8080
  http://192.168.1.21:8080
Hit CTRL-C to stop the server
```

3. Visit `http://localhost:8080` in browser.   

4. Make changes in `data/profile.js` file, and refresh the page in browser. Additionaly you can also make changes in architecture and design of the page  as well.

5. Save/Print the page in PDF. Your Resume is ready.
